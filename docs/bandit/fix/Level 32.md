Welcome to OverTheWire!

 

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on

discord or IRC.

 

\--\[ Playing the games \]\--

 

This machine might hold several wargames.

If you are playing \"somegame\", then:

 

\* USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, \...

\* Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.

\* PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

 

Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a

working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/. You can use the

command \"mktemp -d\" in order to generate a random and hard to guess

directory in /tmp/. Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc

restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories

with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp

directory is regularly wiped.

Please play nice:

 

\* don\'t leave orphan processes running

\* don\'t leave exploit-files laying around

\* don\'t annoy other players

\* don\'t post passwords or spoilers

\* again, DONT POST SPOILERS!

This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

 

\--\[ Tips \]\--

 

This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled

by default, although ASLR has been switched off. The following

compiler flags might be interesting:

 

-m32 compile for 32bit

-fno-stack-protector disable ProPolice

-Wl,-z,norelro disable relro

 

In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as

executable on ELF binaries.

 

Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local

firewall.

 

\--\[ Tools \]\--

 

For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find

in the following locations:

 

\* gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/

\* pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/

\* gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/

\* pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)

\* radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)

 

\--\[ More information \]\--
